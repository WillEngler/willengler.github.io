# Personal Site

A minimal personal website built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Update `astro.config.mjs` with your GitHub username and repository name
2. Push to a GitHub repository
3. Go to Settings → Pages → Source → select "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to `main` to trigger a deploy

## Making it yours

- Edit `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` to change your name and navigation
- Edit `src/pages/index.astro` and `src/pages/about.astro` for your content
- Add blog posts as Markdown files in `src/content/blog/`
- Tweak colors and fonts in `public/styles/global.css`
